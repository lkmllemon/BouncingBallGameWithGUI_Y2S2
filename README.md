# Bouncing Ball Game With GUI 
### JavaFX is included in this project.
## This project aims to use JavaFX to develop a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) game (Bouncing Ball).
### Project Description
#### 1. Create a rectangle paddle and a circle ball.
#### 2. The padded can move left or right using the LEFT <- and RIGHT -> keyboard.
#### 3. If the ball missed the paddle within the 30s, the score = -1, else the score =1. 
#### 4. Perform the games for 5 stages and each stage having a 30-second duration. Create a timer to count down the game time.
#### 5. At the end of the game, a pop-up window will show the total score of those 5 stages.
#### 6. The outcome of the project should be able to show a GUI.
